Personal project to explore Strava segment data from Veloviewer.

During the 2020 lockdown I put together a list of local bike climbs to challenge myself on and see where I could get to on the leaderboards. I wanted a variety of climbs so it is quite a long list.  Veloviewer gives a nice mix of measures as well as rankings. For example, there are several comparisons with the leader's time and a Veloviewer score which compares your position to the total number of people who have done the segment.
