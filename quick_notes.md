# Quick Notes

`dist_km` is in metres in 2022 data. In first dataset only it was `dist_m`. Add check but keep in metres?
`dist_start_to_end_km` also in m.

## Column Background Info

rp is relative power, pVAM is VAM adjusted for grade http://www.cyclismas.com/biscuits/a-different-approach-to-comparing-climbing-performances/
vvom is veloviewer objective measure (climb difficulty) https://blog.veloviewer.com/strava-segmentclimb-comparison-and-vvom/ 

## Segment Notes

Massif Marshaw and Endless starts higher up (next junc) than other two.  MM ends before corner.
Waste lane climb ends just after corner.

### Segment name change issue

Two harris end segments aren't correct on vv.
https://veloviewer.com/segments/1266203 is out of date but https://www.strava.com/segments/1266203 is correct.
The segment changed name but then the new one disappeared. 
Not on vv activity https://veloviewer.com/athletes/5421752/activities/3466128287
New similar segment https://veloviewer.com/segments/12590924
I have added this to csv. I can probably delete the Oakenclough seg
Also probably replace https://veloviewer.com/segments/3544125 with https://veloviewer.com/segments/883222
